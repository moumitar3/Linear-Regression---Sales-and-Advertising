# Linear Regression- Sales Prediction
End to end Linear Regression Project

Linear Regression is a supervised machine learning algorithm. 
It shows a linear relationship between a dependent and one/more independent variables. It finds how the value of the dependent variable is changing according to the value of the independent variable.  
Linear regression makes predictions for continuous/real or numeric variables such as sales, salary, age, product price etc.
Linear regression can be further divided into two types of the algorithm:
-	Simple Linear Regression: When single independent variable is used to predict the value of a numerical dependent variable.
-	Multiple Linear regression: When more than one independent variable is used to predict the value of a numerical dependent variable.

# Project
#### Business Problem - A company wants to find out the sales by investing a certain amount on advertisement on TV, radio and newspaper. 

To solve this problem, we have used historical data of investment and sales value and we have prepared our dataset.
Next we have created a Linear Regression model and fitted the dataset with the model. 
After testing the model, we have saved the model for future use. 
Finally, we have integrated the model with tkinter GUI.
